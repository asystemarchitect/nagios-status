# nagios-status

## Overview 

These are a series of scripts that display Nagios' status on the command-line
similar to what you see in the Nagios web UI.

## Setup 

All of these scripts look for the Nagios status.dat file to parse status information,
so be sure to set the path correctly before using them.
